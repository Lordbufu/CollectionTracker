## This readme is still a work in progress, as i am rather new to all this, and more focussed on the project itself

The core of this WebApp is based on a Laracast course, that can be found here (outdated): [Laracast](https://laracasts.com/series/php-for-beginners)

The Repository for said course can be found here: [Source Code](https://github.com/laracasts/The-PHP-Practitioner-Full-Source-Code)

I dint feel like i needed a complex framework, since this is only a small project, mostly intended as a learning project.
I am using IIS to host my development enviroment, and despite it having improved, some things might be slightly different because of that.

......

More usefull stuff will follow at somepoint in time.
