## This readme is still a work in progress, as i am rather new to all this, and more focussed on the project itself

This project was based on the following laracast learning resources:
	PHP practitioner - https://laracasts.com/series/php-for-beginners
	Source code - https://github.com/laracasts/The-PHP-Practitioner-Full-Source-Code
	
	PHP For Beginners - https://laracasts.com/series/php-for-beginners-2023-edition

This project was started to give me a better idea of what backend webdevelopment is all about, and how a project looks like in a work enviroment.
It also was as a good way to see where i can improve myself, and what my strength\weaknesses are in terms of backend development.
Like mixing dutch and english in the code, turned out to be a very bad idea, and something i would do very different on a new project.
But also the mess of classes that i made, that was more of a personal experiment then anything else, it all works as intended but in some cases not realy a good way of doing things.

I am also not a designer, so a the overall design and look/feel is likely to be lacking quite a bit.
And because its my first full project, some it looks very much tagged on after the design phase, simply because it likely was.

Requirements to run this project:
	- XAMPP or a other hosting solution:
		- Appache.
		- PhP (v8.2.12 or higher).
		- (optional) PhPMyAdmin.
	- A MYSQL compatible database.
		- (used for development) MariaDB:
			- charset: UTF-8 Unicode (utf8mb4) 
			- collation: latin1_swedish_ci
	- Composer.

The database details in 'config.php', should be updated to what ever your enviroment settings are.
As long as you use software like XAMPP, there really isnt a need for a details installation guide.
Besides telling you to run 'composer dump-autoload' from the project root, to get all the remaining required files.

This project remains public for portfolio reasons, likely not my best work, but should eventually give a good idea of my personal growth should i keep on doing this type of work.

A few images to show how the project looks like when its live, and has a populated database:
