## This readme is still a work in progress, as i am rather new to all this, and more focussed on the project itself

The core of this WebApp is based on a Laracast course, that can be found here:
  https://laracasts.com/series/php-for-beginners

The Repository for said course can be found here:
  https://github.com/laracasts/The-PHP-Practitioner-Full-Source-Code

I dint feel like i needed a complex framework, since this is only a small project, mostly intended as a learning project.
If im not mistaken they have updated said course since i did it, and somethings might be slightly different, as hosting on IIS is slightly different and had some minor side effects.
But its been a while since i looked into the latter, so it might just as well be my own lack of knowledge, that i never ended up solving as i moved to other courses/trainings.

......

More usefull stuff will follow at somepoint in time.
