Global TODO List:
    - Write the admin password reset code, a i seem to have forgotten about that.
    - Review if 'more-info-mobile' is still relevant or usefull, atm most of it is not correctly implemented yet.

    ## This should likely be done last, as its possible i cant resolve this in a way that i would prefer to have it ##
    - Review how to deal with to long strings in general, atm i give feedback that its to long or short.
        - But how do i deal with very long descriptions from the Google API or user input, when there is no indication of what the input count is ?
        - How should i better deal with the feedback here, since the user cant see the length before submitting, and there is no indication of the limit iether.
    - Remove the uncommented JS section, to allow for image uploads to the barcode scanner pop-in.
    - If i find some extra time, i should rework the ISBN class, right now its just seems overly complex.
