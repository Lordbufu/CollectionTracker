Global TODO List:
    - Look at all user inputs, and make sure they are filtered properly before displaying them on the website again (even after being stored in the database).
    - Review what css is redundant in 'modal-style.css', considering the latest re-factor of the design/code base.
    - Review the parsing for the FileHandler, it might still need more decent error handeling, so i dont store potentially harmfull strings Â¿
    - Review if 'more-info-mobile' is still relevant or usefull, atm most of it is not correctly implemented yet.
