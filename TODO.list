Global TODO List:
    - Review the 'newCover' in the 'controllers\items\edit.php' file.
    - Review a error path in the 'controllers\scan\search.php', it seems redundant to error check the returned result twice.
    - See if i can make a more interesting complex password check, atm it seem very dumb.
    - Add the newly added Reeks cover to all related view, and pop-ins/templates.
        - And while doing so, add all controller related code, and class related code where needed.
    - The 'Isbn' core class, still needs more clean up, and potentially improvements.
        - For now it works as expected, but seems overly complex, and is still missing a way to deal with (for example), multiple writers.
    - Review how to deal with multiple autheurs/writers, in the scan controllers (confirm.php).
    - Review if 'more-info-mobile' is still relevant or usefull, atm most of it is not correctly implemented yet.
