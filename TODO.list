Global TODO List:
    - Go over all Core classes and controllers, and make sure there are useful comments:
        - Also clear up any comment clutter that is left over from the concept/design phase.
    - Review if 'more-info-mobile' is still relevant or usefull, atm most of it is not correctly implemented yet.
