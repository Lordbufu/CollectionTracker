Global TODO List:
    - Go over all Core classes, and make sure there are useful comments:
        - Still need to clean up:
            - App.php
            - Isbn.php
            - SessionMan.php
            - Collectie.php
            - Router.php ?
    - Go over all controllers once more, to make sure the formatting and comments are in order.
    - Figure out how a expired session, or incorrect user data is dealt with.
        - Atm it seems to not redirect properly, causing all kinds of weird issues.
    - See if i can make a more interesting complex password check, atm it seem very dumb.
    - Review if the greaterThan function in the Validator has any remaining uses.
    - Review if i even use the ValidationException class at all now.
    - Remember to clean up the verifyUser() function in the Authenticator core class, as its not very usefull considering the middleware im using.
        - Or include it in the middleware, to verify the user in a more interesting way Â¿
    - Review the 'newCover' in the 'controllers\items\edit.php' file.
    - Review how to deal with multiple autheurs/writers, in the scan controllers (confirm.php).
    - Review a error path in the 'controllers\scan\search.php', it seems redundant to error check the returned result twice.
    - Review if 'more-info-mobile' is still relevant or usefull, atm most of it is not correctly implemented yet.
