Global TODO List:
    - Ensure the reeks duplication check is used properly in other parts of the code base (Add actions for example):
        - This duplication check need a review entirely, cause atm it seems to not make any sense, and weekend brain has already set in.
    - Go over all Core classes and controllers, and make sure there are useful comments:
        - Also clear up any comment clutter that is left over from the concept/design phase.
    - Review if 'more-info-mobile' is still relevant or usefull, atm most of it is not correctly implemented yet.
