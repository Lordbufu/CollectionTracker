Global TODO List:
    - Review all controllers once more, and the main object core classes (Items, Reeks, Collectie):
        - Start inserting all the missing form validation code, as i have skipped doing those on most actions.
        - Replace any key searches for name/index etc to a single getKey() function like in Items.
        - Prepare the Reeks class for dealing with the newly added reeks cover data.
            - Proll change the database code and table to be longblob instead of just blob ?
        - Adjust the core classes to deal with the added validation and post processing code.
    - See if i can make a more interesting complex password check, atm it seem very dumb.
    - Adjust JS input validation, to be inline with string lengths set in the FormValidator class.

    ## This should likely be done last, as its possible i cant resolve this in a way that i would prefer to have it ##
    - Review what i am doing with the version noted in the config.php, i proll had a plan for that, but never actually used it ?
    - The 'Isbn' core class, still needs more clean up, and potentially improvements.
        - For now it works as expected, but seems overly complex, and is still missing a way to deal with (for example), multiple writers.
        - Review how to deal with multiple autheurs/writers, in the scan controllers (confirm.php).
    - Review if 'more-info-mobile' is still relevant or usefull, atm most of it is not correctly implemented yet.
