Global TODO List:
    ## This should likely be done last, as its possible i cant resolve this in a way that i would prefer to have it ##
    - Review if i want the default user, to be able to change there own password.
    - Request feedback on the any extra visual validation requirments.
    - Remove the uncommented JS section, to allow for image uploads to the barcode scanner pop-in.
    - If i find some extra time, i should rework the ISBN class, right now its just seems way to complex.
